# Quirk Overrides Module

This module is the receptacle for overrides of pre-existing TG Quirks.

If you want to override a stock TG quirk or one of it's vars/procs/behaviors, this is the module to use.

If you're trying to add a new Quirk, or want to learn more about Nova Sector's Quirks, see the [Quirk Additions Module](/modular_nova/modules/quirks/README.md)
